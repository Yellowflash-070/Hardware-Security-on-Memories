# Hardware-Security-on-Memories
This project is an attempt to develop hardware solutions to enhance the security of semiconductor memories. <br> 

In Phase 1 of this project, we research about various types of Hardware Trojan Attacks on a 6T SRAM cell. A Hardware Trojan is any kind of modification done on a piece of Hardware with some malicious intent (Denial of Service (DoS), Information Leakage). In particular, we study about Analog Hardware Trojan Attacks which consists of some type of Analog component (like capacitors). We use this attack to trigger a 6T SRAM cell to control and access its contents without the actual will of its designated user. <br>

In Phase 2 of this project, we devise a solution to mitigate an attack on SRAM cell / array. We do so by implementing a locking mechanism which secures the memory (SRAM cell/ array) from unauthorized access.
