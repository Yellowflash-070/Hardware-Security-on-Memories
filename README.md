# Hardware-Security-on-Memories
This project is an attempt to develop hardware solutions to enhance the security of semiconductor memories. As part of this, we implement an Analog Hardware Trojan (a type of hardware attack) to study its impact on the performance of a 6T SRAM cell. Furthermore, we also implement a secuirty measure to prevent unauthorized access to our memory.
